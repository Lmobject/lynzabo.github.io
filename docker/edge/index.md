The current Docker CE Edge release is {{ site.docker_ce_edge_version }}. The Docker CE
Edge channel provides monthly releases which allow you to try new features of
Docker and verify bug fixes quickly. Edge releases are only supported for one
month, and a given Edge release will not receive any updates once a new edge
release is available.

Stable releases are not published to the Edge channel, so Linux repository users
still need to subscribe to the stable channel as well.

Commercial support is not available for Docker CE.

For information about all Docker release channels and expectations about
support, see [Docker channels](/engine/installation/#docker-channels).

This page lists features that are only available in Docker CE Edge releases.
Where applicable, the API and CLI reference documentation has been updated to
reflect these features, but **full documentation for a given feature may not be
available until a Docker CE Stable release incorporates the feature**.
