## Prerequisites

- [Install Docker version 1.13 or higher](/engine/installation/).
- Get [Docker Compose](/compose/overview.md) as described in [Part 3 prerequisites](/get-started/part3.md#prerequisites).
- Get [Docker Machine](/machine/overview.md) as described in [Part 4 prerequisites](/get-started/part4.md#prerequisites).
- Read the orientation in [Part 1](index.md).
- Learn how to create containers in [Part 2](part2.md).

- Make sure you have published the `friendlyhello` image you created by
[pushing it to a registry](/get-started/part2.md#share-your-image). We'll
use that shared image here.

- Be sure your image works as a deployed container. Run this command,
slotting in your info for `username`, `repo`, and `tag`: `docker run -p 80:80
username/repo:tag`, then visit `http://localhost/`.

- Have a copy of your `docker-compose.yml` from [Part 3](part3.md) handy.

- Make sure that the machines you set up in [part 4](part4.md) are running
and ready. Run `docker-machine ls` to verify this. If the machines are
stopped, run `docker-machine start myvm1` to boot the manager, followed
by `docker-machine start myvm2` to boot the worker.

- Have the swarm you created in [part 4](part4.md) running and ready. Run
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls"` to verify this. If the swarm is up,
both nodes will report a `ready` status. If not, reinitialze the swarm and join
the worker as described in [Set up your
swarm](/get-started/part4.md#set-up-your-swarm).

## Introduction

In [part 4](part4.md), you learned how to set up a swarm, which is a cluster of
machines running Docker, and deployed an application to it, with containers
running in concert on multiple machines.

Here in part 5, you'll reach the top of the hierarchy of distributed
applications: the **stack**. A stack is a group of interrelated services that
share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together. A single stack
is capable of defining and coordinating the functionality of an entire
application (though very complex applications may want to use multiple stacks).

Some good news is, you have technically been working with stacks since part 3,
when you created a Compose file and used `docker stack deploy`. But that was a
single service stack running on a single host, which is not usually what takes
place in production. Here, you will take what you've learned, make
multiple services relate to each other, and run them on multiple machines.

You're doing great, this is the home stretch!

## Add a new service and redeploy

It's easy to add services to our `docker-compose.yml` file. First, let's add
a free visualizer service that lets us look at how our swarm is scheduling
containers.

1.  Open up `docker-compose.yml` in an editor and replace its contents
with the following. Be sure to replace `username/repo:tag` with your image details.

    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    services:
      web:
        # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
        image: username/repo:tag
        deploy:
          replicas: 5
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: "0.1"
              memory: 50M
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        networks:
          - webnet
      visualizer:
        image: dockersamples/visualizer:stable
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
        deploy:
          placement:
            constraints: [node.role == manager]
        networks:
          - webnet
    networks:
      webnet:
    ```

    The only thing new here is the peer service to `web`, named `visualizer`.
    You'll see two new things here: a `volumes` key, giving the visualizer
    access to the host's socket file for Docker, and a `placement` key, ensuring
    that this service only ever runs on a swarm manager -- never a worker.
    That's because this container, built from [an open source project created by
    Docker](https://github.com/ManoMarks/docker-swarm-visualizer), displays
    Docker services running on a swarm in a diagram.

    We'll talk more about placement constraints and volumes in a moment.

2.  Make sure your shell is configured to talk to `myvm1` (full examples are [here](part4.md#configure-a-docker-machine-shell-to-the-swarm-manager)).

    * Run `docker-machine ls` to list machines and make sure you are connected to `myvm1`, as indicated by an asterisk next it.

    * If needed, re-run `docker-machine env myvm1`, then run the given command to configure the shell.

      On **Mac or Linux** the command is:

      ```shell
      eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
      ```

      On **Windows** the command is:

      ```shell
      & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1 | Invoke-Expression
      ```

3.  Re-run the `docker stack deploy` command on the manager, and
whatever services need updating will be updated:

    ```shell
    $ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab
    Updating service getstartedlab_web (id: angi1bf5e4to03qu9f93trnxm)
    Creating service getstartedlab_visualizer (id: l9mnwkeq2jiononb5ihz9u7a4)
    ```

4.  Take a look at the visualizer.

    You saw in the Compose file that `visualizer` runs on port 8080. Get the
    IP address of one of your nodes by running `docker-machine ls`. Go
    to either IP address at port 8080 and you will see the visualizer running:

    ![Visualizer screenshot](images/get-started-visualizer1.png)

    The single copy of `visualizer` is running on the manager as you expect, and
    the 5 instances of `web` are spread out across the swarm. You can
    corroborate this visualization by running `docker stack ps <stack>`:

    ```shell
    docker stack ps getstartedlab
    ```

    The visualizer is a standalone service that can run in any app
    that includes it in the stack. It doesn't depend on anything else.
    Now let's create a service that *does* have a dependency: the Redis
    service that will provide a visitor counter.

## Persist the data

Let's go through the same workflow once more to add a Redis database for storing
app data.

1.  Save this new `docker-compose.yml` file, which finally adds a
Redis service. Be sure to replace `username/repo:tag` with your image details.

    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    services:
      web:
        # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
        image: username/repo:tag
        deploy:
          replicas: 5
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: "0.1"
              memory: 50M
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        networks:
          - webnet
      visualizer:
        image: dockersamples/visualizer:stable
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
        deploy:
          placement:
            constraints: [node.role == manager]
        networks:
          - webnet
      redis:
        image: redis
        ports:
          - "6379:6379"
        volumes:
          - /home/docker/data:/data
        deploy:
          placement:
            constraints: [node.role == manager]
        command: redis-server --appendonly yes
        networks:
          - webnet
    networks:
      webnet:
    ```

    Redis has an official image in the Docker library and has been granted the
    short `image` name of just `redis`, so no `username/repo` notation here. The
    Redis port, 6379, has been pre-configured by Redis to be exposed from the
    container to the host, and here in our Compose file we expose it from the
    host to the world, so you can actually enter the IP for any of your nodes
    into Redis Desktop Manager and manage this Redis instance, if you so choose.

    Most importantly, there are a couple of things in the `redis` specification
    that make data persist between deployments of this stack:

    - `redis` always runs on the manager, so it's always using the
    same filesystem.
    - `redis` accesses an arbitrary directory in the host's file system
    as `/data` inside the container, which is where Redis stores data.

    Together, this is creating a "source of truth" in your host's physical
    filesystem for the Redis data. Without this, Redis would store its data in
    `/data` inside the container's filesystem, which would get wiped out if that
    container were ever redeployed.

    This source of truth has two components:

    - The placement constraint you put on the Redis service, ensuring that it
      always uses the same host.
    - The volume you created that lets the container access `./data` (on the host) as `/data` (inside the Redis container). While containers come and go, the files stored on `./data` on the specified host will persist, enabling continuity.

    You are ready to deploy your new Redis-using stack.

2.  Create a `./data` directory on the manager:

    ```shell
    docker-machine ssh myvm1 "mkdir ./data"
    ```

3.  Make sure your shell is configured to talk to `myvm1` (full examples are [here](part4.md#configure-a-docker-machine-shell-to-the-swarm-manager)).

    * Run `docker-machine ls` to list machines and make sure you are connected to `myvm1`, as indicated by an asterisk next it.

    * If needed, re-run `docker-machine env myvm1`, then run the given command to configure the shell.

      On **Mac or Linux** the command is:

      ```shell
      eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
      ```

      On **Windows** the command is:

      ```shell
      & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1 | Invoke-Expression
      ```

4.  Run `docker stack deploy` one more time.

    ```shell
    $ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab
    ```

5.  Run `docker service ls` to verify that the three services are running as expected.

    ```shell
    $ docker service ls
    ID                  NAME                       MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE                             PORTS
    x7uij6xb4foj        getstartedlab_redis        replicated          1/1                 redis:latest                      *:6379->6379/tcp
    n5rvhm52ykq7        getstartedlab_visualizer   replicated          1/1                 dockersamples/visualizer:stable   *:8080->8080/tcp
    mifd433bti1d        getstartedlab_web          replicated          5/5                 orangesnap/getstarted:latest    *:80->80/tcp

    ```

6.  Check the web page at one of your nodes (e.g. `http://192.168.99.101`) and you'll see the results of the visitor counter, which is now live and storing information on Redis.

    ![Hello World in browser with Redis](images/app-in-browser-redis.png)

    Also, check the visualizer at port 8080 on either node's IP address, and you'll see the `redis` service running along with the `web` and `visualizer` services.

## Recap (optional)

Here's [a terminal recording of what was covered on this page](https://asciinema.org/a/113840):

You learned that stacks are inter-related services all running in concert, and
that -- surprise! -- you've been using stacks since part three of this tutorial.
You learned that to add more services to your stack, you insert them in your
Compose file. Finally, you learned that by using a combination of placement
constraints and volumes you can create a permanent home for persisting data, so
that your app's data survives when the container is torn down and redeployed.
