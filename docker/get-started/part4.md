## Prerequisites

- [Install Docker version 1.13 or higher](/engine/installation/index.md).

- Get [Docker Compose](/compose/overview.md) as described in [Part 3 prerequisites](/get-started/part3.md#prerequisites).

- Get [Docker Machine](/machine/overview.md), which is pre-installed with
[Docker for Mac](/docker-for-mac/index.md) and [Docker for
Windows](/docker-for-windows/index.md), but on Linux systems you need to
[install it directly](/machine/install-machine/#installing-machine-directly). On pre Windows 10 systems _without Hyper-V_, as well as Windows 10 Home, use
[Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview.md).

- Read the orientation in [Part 1](index.md).

- Learn how to create containers in [Part 2](part2.md).

- Make sure you have published the `friendlyhello` image you created by
[pushing it to a registry](/get-started/part2.md#share-your-image). We'll
be using that shared image here.

- Be sure your image works as a deployed container. Run this command,
slotting in your info for `username`, `repo`, and `tag`: `docker run -p 80:80
username/repo:tag`, then visit `http://localhost/`.

- Have a copy of your `docker-compose.yml` from [Part 3](part3.md) handy.

## Introduction

In [part 3](part3.md), you took an app you wrote in [part 2](part2.md), and
defined how it should run in production by turning it into a service, scaling it
up 5x in the process.

Here in part 4, you deploy this application onto a cluster, running it on
multiple machines. Multi-container, multi-machine applications are made possible
by joining multiple machines into a "Dockerized" cluster called a **swarm**.

## Understanding Swarm clusters

A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into
a cluster. After that has happened, you continue to run the Docker commands
you're used to, but now they are executed on a cluster by a **swarm manager**.
The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. After joining a swarm, they
are referred to as **nodes**.

Swarm managers can use several strategies to run containers, such as "emptiest
node" -- which fills the least utilized machines with containers. Or "global",
which ensures that each machine gets exactly one instance of the specified
container. You instruct the swarm manager to use these strategies in the Compose
file, just like the one you have already been using.

Swarm managers are the only machines in a swarm that can execute your commands,
or authorize other machines to join the swarm as **workers**. Workers are just
there to provide capacity and do not have the authority to tell any other
machine what it can and cannot do.

Up until now, you have been using Docker in a single-host mode on your local
machine. But Docker also can be switched into **swarm mode**, and that's what
enables the use of swarms. Enabling swarm mode instantly makes the current
machine a swarm manager. From then on, Docker will run the commands you execute
on the swarm you're managing, rather than just on the current machine.

## Set up your swarm

A swarm is made up of multiple nodes, which can be either physical or virtual
machines. The basic concept is simple enough: run `docker swarm init` to enable
swarm mode and make your current machine a swarm manager, then run
`docker swarm join` on other machines to have them join the swarm as workers.
Choose a tab below to see how this plays out in various contexts. We'll use VMs
to quickly create a two-machine cluster and turn it into a swarm.

### Create a cluster

<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
  <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#local">Local VMs (Mac, Linux, Windows 7 and 8)</a></li>
  <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#localwin">Local VMs (Windows 10/Hyper-V)</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-content">
  <div id="local" class="tab-pane fade in active">
{% capture local-content %}

#### VMs on your local machine (Mac, Linux, Windows 7 and 8)

First, you'll need a hypervisor that can create virtual machines (VMs), so
[install Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your
machine's OS.

> **Note**: If you are on a Windows system that has Hyper-V installed,
such as Windows 10, there is no need to install VirtualBox and you should
use Hyper-V instead. View the instructions for Hyper-V systems by clicking
the Hyper-V tab above. If you are using
[Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview.md), you should already have
VirtualBox installed as part of it, so you are good to go.

Now, create a couple of VMs using `docker-machine`, using the VirtualBox driver:

```shell
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm2
```

{% endcapture %}
{{ local-content | markdownify }}

</div>
<div id="localwin" class="tab-pane fade" markdown="1">
{% capture localwin-content %}

#### VMs on your local machine (Windows 10)

First, quickly create a virtual switch for your virtual machines (VMs) to share,
so they will be able to connect to each other.

1. Launch Hyper-V Manager
2. Click **Virtual Switch Manager** in the right-hand menu
3. Click **Create Virtual Switch** of type **External**
4. Give it the name `myswitch`, and check the box to share your host machine's
   active network adapter

Now, create a couple of VMs using our node management tool,
`docker-machine`:

```shell
docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" myvm1
docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" myvm2
```

{% endcapture %}
{{ localwin-content | markdownify }}
</div>
<hr>
</div>

#### List the VMs and get their IP addresses

You now have two VMs created, named `myvm1` and `myvm2`.

Use this command to list the machines and get their IP addresses.

```shell
docker-machine ls
```

Here is example output from this command.

```shell
$ docker-machine ls
NAME    ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
myvm1   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v17.06.2-ce   
myvm2   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376           v17.06.2-ce   
```

#### Initialize the swarm and add nodes

The first machine will act as the manager, which executes management commands
and authenticates workers to join the swarm, and the second will be a worker.

You can send commands to your VMs using `docker-machine ssh`. Instruct `myvm1`
to become a swarm manager with `docker swarm init` and you'll see output like
this:

```shell
$ docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr <myvm1 ip>"
Swarm initialized: current node <node ID> is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

  docker swarm join \
  --token <token> \
  <myvm ip>:<port>

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

> Ports 2377 and 2376
>
> Always run `docker swarm init` and `docker swarm join` with port 2377

> docker-machine --native-ssh ssh myvm1 ...
> ```

As you can see, the response to `docker swarm init` contains a pre-configured
`docker swarm join` command for you to run on any nodes you want to add. Copy
this command, and send it to `myvm2` via `docker-machine ssh` to have `myvm2`
join your new swarm as a worker:

```shell
$ docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm join \
--token <token> \
<ip>:2377"

This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

Congratulations, you have created your first swarm!

Run `docker node ls` on the manager to view the nodes in this swarm:

```shell
$ docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls"
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
brtu9urxwfd5j0zrmkubhpkbd     myvm2               Ready               Active
rihwohkh3ph38fhillhhb84sk *   myvm1               Ready               Active              Leader
```

> Leaving a swarm
>
> If you want to start over, you can run `docker swarm leave` from each node.

## Deploy your app on the swarm cluster

The hard part is over. Now you just repeat the process you used in [part
3](part3.md) to deploy on your new swarm. Just remember that only swarm managers
like `myvm1` execute Docker commands; workers are just for capacity.

### Configure a `docker-machine` shell to the swarm manager

So far, you've been wrapping Docker commands in `docker-machine ssh` to talk to
the VMs. Another option is to run `docker-machine env <machine>` to get
and run a command that configures your current shell to talk to the Docker
daemon on the VM. This method works better for the next step because it allows
you to use your local `docker-compose.yml` file to deploy the app
"remotely" without having to copy it anywhere.

Type `docker-machine env myvm1`, then copy-paste and run the command provided as
the last line of the output to configure your shell to talk to `myvm1`, the
swarm manager.

The commands to configure your shell differ depending on whether you are Mac,
Linux, or Windows, so examples of each are shown on the tabs below.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
  <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#mac-linux-machine">Mac, Linux</a></li>
  <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#win-machine">Windows</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-content">
  <div id="mac-linux-machine" class="tab-pane fade in active">
  {% capture mac-linux-machine-content %}

#### Docker machine shell environment on Mac or Linux

Run `docker-machine env myvm1` to get the command to configure your shell to
talk to `myvm1`.

```shell
$ docker-machine env myvm1
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/sam/.docker/machine/machines/myvm1"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="myvm1"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
```

Run the given command to configure your shell to talk to `myvm1`.

```shell
eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
```

Run `docker-machine ls` to verify that `myvm1` is now the active machine, as
indicated by the asterisk next to it.

```shell
$ docker-machine ls
NAME    ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
myvm1   *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v17.06.2-ce   
myvm2   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376           v17.06.2-ce   
```

<div id="win-machine" class="tab-pane fade">
{% capture win-machine-content %}

#### Docker machine shell environment on Windows

Run `docker-machine env myvm1` to get the command to configure your shell to
talk to `myvm1`.

```shell
PS C:\Users\sam\sandbox\get-started> docker-machine env myvm1
$Env:DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY = "1"
$Env:DOCKER_HOST = "tcp://192.168.203.207:2376"
$Env:DOCKER_CERT_PATH = "C:\Users\sam\.docker\machine\machines\myvm1"
$Env:DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME = "myvm1"
$Env:COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS = "true"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1 | Invoke-Expression
```

Run the given command to configure your shell to talk to `myvm1`.

```shell
& "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1 | Invoke-Expression
```

Run `docker-machine ls` to verify that `myvm1` is the active machine as indicated by the asterisk next to it.

```shell
PS C:PATH> docker-machine ls
NAME    ACTIVE   DRIVER   STATE     URL                          SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
myvm1   *        hyperv   Running   tcp://192.168.203.207:2376           v17.06.2-ce
myvm2   -        hyperv   Running   tcp://192.168.200.181:2376           v17.06.2-ce
```

### Deploy the app on the swarm manager

Now that you have my `myvm1`, you can use its powers as a swarm manager to
deploy your app by using the same `docker stack deploy` command you used in part
3 to `myvm1`, and your local copy of `docker-compose.yml.`

You are connected to `myvm1` by means of the `docker-machine` shell
configuration, and you still have access to the files on your local host. Make
sure you are in the same directory as before, which includes the
[`docker-compose.yml` file you created in part
3](/get-started/part3/#docker-composeyml).

Just like before, run the following command to deploy the app on `myvm1`.

```
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab
```

And that's it, the app is deployed on a swarm cluster!

Now you can use the same [docker commands you used in part
3](/get-started/part3.md#run-your-new-load-balanced-app). Only this time you'll
see that the services (and associated containers) have been distributed between
both `myvm1` and `myvm2`.

```
$ docker stack ps getstartedlab

ID            NAME                  IMAGE                   NODE   DESIRED STATE
jq2g3qp8nzwx  getstartedlab_web.1   john/get-started:part2  myvm1  Running
88wgshobzoxl  getstartedlab_web.2   john/get-started:part2  myvm2  Running
vbb1qbkb0o2z  getstartedlab_web.3   john/get-started:part2  myvm2  Running
ghii74p9budx  getstartedlab_web.4   john/get-started:part2  myvm1  Running
0prmarhavs87  getstartedlab_web.5   john/get-started:part2  myvm2  Running
```

> Connecting to VMs with `docker-machine env` and `docker-machine ssh`
>
> * To set your shell to talk to a different machine like `myvm2`, simply re-run
`docker-machine env` in the same or a different shell, then run the given
command to point to `myvm2`. This is always specific to the current shell. If
you change to an unconfigured shell or open a new one, you need to re-run the
commands. Use `docker-machine ls` to list machines, see what state they are in,
get IP addresses, and find out which one, if any, you are connected to. To learn
more, see the [Docker Machine getting started topics](/machine/get-started.md#create-a-machine).

`docker-machine ssh <machine> "<command>"`, which logs directly into
the VM but doesn't give you immediate access to files on your local host.

to copy files across machines, but Windows users need a Linux terminal emulator

`docker-machine env`, since these are available on all platforms via the `docker-machine` CLI.

### Accessing your cluster

You can access your app from the IP address of **either** `myvm1` or `myvm2`.

The network you created is shared between them and load-balancing. Run
`docker-machine ls` to get your VMs' IP addresses and visit either of them on a
browser, hitting refresh (or just `curl` them).

![Hello World in browser](images/app-in-browser-swarm.png)

You'll see five possible container IDs all cycling by randomly, demonstrating
the load-balancing.

The reason both IP addresses work is that nodes in a swarm participate in an
ingress **routing mesh**. This ensures that a service deployed at a certain port
within your swarm always has that port reserved to itself, no matter what node
is actually running the container. Here's a diagram of how a routing mesh for a
service called `my-web` published at port `8080` on a three-node swarm would
look:

![routing mesh diagram](/engine/swarm/images/ingress-routing-mesh.png)

> Having connectivity trouble?
>
> Keep in mind that in order to use the ingress network in the swarm,
> you need to have the following ports open between the swarm nodes
> before you enable swarm mode:
>
> - Port 7946 TCP/UDP for container network discovery.
> - Port 4789 UDP for the container ingress network.

## Iterating and scaling your app

From here you can do everything you learned about in parts 2 and 3.

Scale the app by changing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Change the app behavior by editing code, then rebuild, and push the new image.
(To do this, follow the same steps you took earlier to [build the
app](part2.md#build-the-app) and [publish the
image](part2.md#publish-the-image)).

In either case, simply run `docker stack deploy` again to deploy these changes.

You can join any machine, physical or virtual, to this swarm, using the
same `docker swarm join` command you used on `myvm2`, and capacity will be added
to your cluster. Just run `docker stack deploy` afterwards, and your app will
take advantage of the new resources.

## Cleanup and reboot

### Stacks and swarms

You can tear down the stack with `docker stack rm`. For example:

```
docker stack rm getstartedlab
```

> Keep the swarm or remove it?
>
> At some point later, you can remove this swarm if you want to with
> `docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm leave"` on the worker
> and `docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm leave --force"` on the
> manager, but _you'll need this swarm for part 5, so please keep it
> around for now_.

### Unsetting docker-machine shell variable settings

You can unset the `docker-machine` environment variables in your current shell
with the following command:

```
eval $(docker-machine env -u)
```

This disconnects the shell from `docker-machine` created virtual machines,
and allows you to continue working in the same shell, now using native `docker`
commands (for example, on Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows). To learn more,
see the [Machine topic on unsetting environment variables](/machine/get-started/#unset-environment-variables-in-the-current-shell).

### Restarting Docker machines

If you shut down your local host, Docker machines will stop running. You can check the status of machines by running `docker-machine ls`.

```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME    ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL   SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
myvm1   -        virtualbox   Stopped                 Unknown
myvm2   -        virtualbox   Stopped                 Unknown
```

To restart a machine that's stopped, run:

```
docker-machine start <machine-name>
```

For example:

```
$ docker-machine start myvm1
Starting "myvm1"...
(myvm1) Check network to re-create if needed...
(myvm1) Waiting for an IP...
Machine "myvm1" was started.
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...
Started machines may have new IP addresses. You may need to re-run the `docker-machine env` command.

$ docker-machine start myvm2
Starting "myvm2"...
(myvm2) Check network to re-create if needed...
(myvm2) Waiting for an IP...
Machine "myvm2" was started.
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...
Started machines may have new IP addresses. You may need to re-run the `docker-machine env` command.
```

## Recap and cheat sheet (optional)

Here's [a terminal recording of what was covered on this
page](https://asciinema.org/a/113837):

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/113837.js" id="asciicast-113837" speed="2" async></script>

In part 4 you learned what a swarm is, how nodes in swarms can be managers or
workers, created a swarm, and deployed an application on it. You saw that the
core Docker commands didn't change from part 3, they just had to be targeted to
run on a swarm master. You also saw the power of Docker's networking in action,
which kept load-balancing requests across containers, even though they were
running on different machines. Finally, you learned how to iterate and scale
your app on a cluster.

Here are some commands you might like to run to interact with your swarm and your VMs a bit:

```shell
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1 # Create a VM (Mac, Win7, Linux)
docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" myvm1 # Win10
docker-machine env myvm1                # View basic information about your node
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls"         # List the nodes in your swarm
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node inspect <node ID>"        # Inspect a node
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm join-token -q worker"   # View join token
docker-machine ssh myvm1   # Open an SSH session with the VM; type "exit" to end
docker node ls                # View nodes in swarm (while logged on to manager)
docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm leave"  # Make the worker leave the swarm
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm leave -f" # Make master leave, kill swarm
docker-machine ls # list VMs, asterisk shows which VM this shell is talking to
docker-machine start myvm1            # Start a VM that is currently not running
docker-machine env myvm1      # show environment variables and command for myvm1
eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)         # Mac command to connect shell to myvm1
& "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1 | Invoke-Expression   # Windows command to connect shell to myvm1
docker stack deploy -c <file> <app>  # Deploy an app; command shell must be set to talk to manager (myvm1), uses local Compose file
docker-machine scp docker-compose.yml myvm1:~ # Copy file to node's home dir (only required if you use ssh to connect to manager and deploy the app)
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker stack deploy -c <file> <app>"   # Deploy an app using ssh (you must have first copied the Compose file to myvm1)
eval $(docker-machine env -u)     # Disconnect shell from VMs, use native docker
docker-machine stop $(docker-machine ls -q)               # Stop all running VMs
docker-machine rm $(docker-machine ls -q) # Delete all VMs and their disk images
```
