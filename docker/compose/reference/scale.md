```
Usage: scale [SERVICE=NUM...]
```

Sets the number of containers to run for a service.

Numbers are specified as arguments in the form `service=num`. For example:

    docker-compose scale web=2 worker=3

>**Tip**: Alternatively, in
[Compose file version 3.x](/compose/compose-file/index.md), you can specify
[replicas](/compose/compose-file/index.md#replicas)
under the [deploy](/compose/compose-file/index.md#deploy) key as part of a
service configuration for [Swarm mode](/engine/swarm/). Note that the `deploy` key and its sub-options (including `replicas`) will only work with the `docker stack deploy` command, not `docker compose up` or `docker-compose run`.
