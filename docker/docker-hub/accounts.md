title: Use Docker Hub with Docker ID
---

Docker Hub uses your free [Docker ID](../docker-id/) to save your account
settings, and as your account namespace. If you don't yet have a Docker ID, you
can [register for one](../docker-id/#/register-for-a-docker-id).

You can `search` Docker Hub and `pull` images without an account and
without signing in. However, to `push` images, leave comments, or to *star* a
repository, you need to log in using a Docker ID.

Once you have a personal Docker ID, you can also create or join
Docker Hub [Organizations and Teams](orgs.md).

## Upgrade your account

Free Docker Hub accounts include one private registry. If you need more private
registries, you can [upgrade your account](https://hub.docker.com/account/billing-plans/) to a paid plan directly
from the Hub.

## Password reset process

If you forget your password, or can't access your account for some reason, you
can reset your password from the [*Password Reset*](https://hub.docker.com/reset-password/) page.
