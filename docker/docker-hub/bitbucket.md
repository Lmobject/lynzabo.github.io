If you've previously linked Docker Hub to your Bitbucket account, you'll be able
to skip to [Creating an Automated
Build](bitbucket.md#creating-an-automated-build).

## Link to your Bitbucket account

In order to set up an Automated Build of a repository on Bitbucket, you need to
link your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/)
account to a Bitbucket account. This will allow the registry to see your
Bitbucket repositories.

To add, remove, or view your linked account, go to the **Linked Accounts &
Services** section of your Hub profile **Settings**.

Then follow the onscreen instructions to authorize and link your Bitbucket
account to Docker Hub. Once it is linked, you'll be able to create a Docker Hub
repository from which to create the Automatic Build.

## Create an Automated Build

You can [create an Automated Build](
https://hub.docker.com/add/automated-build/bitbucket/) from any of your public
or private Bitbucket repositories with a `Dockerfile`.

To get started, log in to Docker Hub and click the "Create &#x25BC;" menu item
at the top right of the screen. Then select [Create Automated
Build](https://hub.docker.com/add/automated-build/bitbucket/).

Select the linked Bitbucket account, and then choose a repository to set up
an Automated Build for.

## The Bitbucket webhook

When you create an Automated Build in Docker Hub, a webhook is added to your
Bitbucket repository automatically.

You can also manually add a webhook from your repository's **Settings** page.
Set the URL to `https://registry.hub.docker.com/hooks/bitbucket`, to be
triggered for repository pushes.
