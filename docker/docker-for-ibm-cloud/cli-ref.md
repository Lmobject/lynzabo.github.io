With the Docker EE for IBM Cloud (Beta) plug-in for the IBM Cloud CLI, you can manage your Docker swarms alongside other IBM Cloud operations.

## Docker for IBM Cloud plug-in commands
Refer to these commands to manage your Docker EE for IBM Cloud clusters.

* To view a list of commands, run the `bx d4ic help` command.
* For help with a specific command, run `bx d4ic help [command_name]`.
* To view the version of your Docker for IBM Cloud plug-in, run the `bx d4ic version` command.
