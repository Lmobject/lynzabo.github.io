Docker Enterprise Edition for Windows Server (*Docker EE*) enables native
Docker containers on Windows Server. Windows Server 2016 and later versions are supported. The Docker EE installation package
includes everything you need to run Docker on Windows Server.
This topic describes pre-install considerations, and how to download and
install Docker EE.

## Docker Universal Control Plane and Windows

With Docker EE, your Windows nodes can join swarms that are managed
by Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP). When you have Docker EE installed
on Windows Server 2016 and you have a
[UCP manager node provisioned](/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/install/), you can
[join your Windows worker nodes to a swarm](/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/join-windows-worker-nodes/).

## Install Docker EE

>Windows Server 1709
>
>Docker Universal Control Plane is not currently supported on Windows Server 1709 due to image incompatibility issues.
>To use UCP, for now please use the current LTSB Windows release and not 1709.


Docker EE for Windows requires Windows Server 2016 or later. See
[What to know before you install](#what-to-know-before-you-install) for a
full list of prerequisites.

1.  Open a PowerShell command prompt, and type the following commands.

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module DockerProvider -Force
    Install-Package Docker -ProviderName DockerProvider -Force
    ```

2.  Test your Docker EE installation by running the `hello-world` container.

    ```PowerShell
    docker container run hello-world:nanoserver

    Unable to find image 'hello-world:nanoserver' locally
    nanoserver: Pulling from library/hello-world
    bce2fbc256ea: Pull complete
    3ac17e2e6106: Pull complete
    8cac44e17f16: Pull complete
    5e160e4d8db3: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:25eac12ba40f7591969085ab3fb9772e8a4307553c14ea72d0e6f98b2c8ced9d
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:nanoserver

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    <snip>
    ```

### (optional) Make sure you have all required updates

Some advanced Docker features (like Swarm) require that Windows is updated to include the fixes in [KB4015217](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4015217/windows-10-update-kb4015217) (or a later cumulative patch).

```PowerShell
sconfig
```

Select option `6) Download and Install Updates`.

## Use a script to install Docker EE

Use the following steps when you want to install manually, script automated
installs, or install on air-gapped systems.

1.  In a PowerShell command prompt, download the installer archive on a machine
    that has a connection.

    ```PowerShell
    # On an online machine, download the zip file.
    invoke-webrequest -UseBasicparsing -Outfile {{ filename }} {{ download_url }}
    ```

2.  Copy the zip file to the machine where you want to install Docker. In a
    PowerShell command prompt, use the following commands to extract the archive,
    register, and start the Docker service.

    ```PowerShell
    # Extract the archive.
    Expand-Archive {{ filename }} -DestinationPath $Env:ProgramFiles

    # Clean up the zip file.
    Remove-Item -Force {{ filename }}

    # Install Docker. This will require rebooting.
    $null = Install-WindowsFeature containers

    # Add Docker to the path for the current session.
    $env:path += ";$env:ProgramFiles\docker"

    # Optionally, modify PATH to persist across sessions.
    $newPath = "$env:ProgramFiles\docker;" +
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH",
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $newPath,
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

    # Register the Docker daemon as a service.
    dockerd --register-service

    # Start the Docker service.
    Start-Service docker
    ```

3.  Test your Docker EE installation by running the `hello-world` container.

    ```PowerShell
    docker container run hello-world:nanoserver
    ```

## Install a specific version

To install a specific Docker version, you can use the `MaximumVersion`,`MinimumVersion` or 'RequiredVersion' flags. For example:

```PowerShell
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerProvider -Force -RequiredVersion 17.06.2-ee-5
...
Name                           Version          Source           Summary
----                           -------          ------           -------
Docker                         17.03.0-ee       Docker           Contains Docker EE for use with Windows Server 2016...
```

## Update Docker EE

> **Check that you have the Docker module**
> You may have previously installed Docker using a Microsoft provided module. To ensure you get the latest Docker patches, please remove this module and use Docker's module:
>
> ```none
> Uninstall-Module DockerMsftProvider -Force
> Install-Module DockerProvider -Force
> ```

To update Docker EE on Windows Server 2016:

```PowerShell
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerProvider -Update -Force
```

If Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is installed, run the
[UCP installation script for Windows](/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/join-windows-worker-nodes/#run-the-windows-node-setup-script). 

Start the Docker service:

```PowerShell
Start-Service Docker
```
