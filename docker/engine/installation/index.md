Docker is available in two editions: **Community Edition (CE)** and **Enterprise
Edition (EE)**.

Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for developers and small
teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based
apps. Docker CE has two update channels, **stable** and **edge**:

* **Stable** gives you reliable updates every quarter
* **Edge** gives you new features every month

For more information about Docker CE, see
[Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition/){: target="_blank" class="_" }.

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is designed for enterprise
development and IT teams who build, ship, and run business critical
applications in production at scale. For more information about Docker EE,
including purchasing options, see
[Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition/){: target="_blank" class="_" }.

  year** after it is released.
- A given Docker CE Stable release will receive patches and updates for **one
  month after the next Docker CE Stable release**.
- A given Docker CE Edge release will not receive any patches or updates after
  a subsequent Docker CE Edge or Stable release.
