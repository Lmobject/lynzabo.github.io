description: Set environment variables on a machine
keywords: machine, env, subcommand
title: docker-machine env
---

Set environment variables to dictate that `docker` should run a command against
a particular machine.

```none
$ docker-machine env --help

Usage: docker-machine env [OPTIONS] [arg...]

Display the commands to set up the environment for the Docker client

Description:
   Argument is a machine name.

Options:

   --swarm	Display the Swarm config instead of the Docker daemon
   --shell 	Force environment to be configured for a specified shell: [fish, cmd, powershell, tcsh], default is sh/bash
   --unset, -u	Unset variables instead of setting them
   --no-proxy	Add machine IP to NO_PROXY environment variable
```

`docker-machine env machinename` will print out `export` commands which can be
run in a subshell. Running `docker-machine env -u` will print `unset` commands
which reverse this effect.

```none
$ env | grep DOCKER
$ eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"
$ env | grep DOCKER
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.101:2376
DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/nathanleclaire/.docker/machines/.client
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=dev
$ # If you run a docker command, now it will run against that host.
$ eval "$(docker-machine env -u)"
$ env | grep DOCKER
$ # The environment variables have been unset.
```

The output described above is intended for the shells `bash` and `zsh` (if
you're not sure which shell you're using, there's a very good possibility that
it's `bash`). However, these are not the only shells which Docker Machine
supports. Docker Machine detects the shells available in your environment and lists them.
Docker supports `bash`, `cmd`, `powershell`, and `emacs`.

If you are using `fish` and the `SHELL` environment variable is correctly set to
the path where `fish` is located, `docker-machine env name` will print out the
values in the format which `fish` expects:

```none
set -x DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY 1;
set -x DOCKER_CERT_PATH "/Users/nathanleclaire/.docker/machine/machines/overlay";
set -x DOCKER_HOST tcp://192.168.99.102:2376;
set -x DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME overlay
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval "$(docker-machine env overlay)"
```

If you are on Windows and using either PowerShell or `cmd.exe`, `docker-machine env`
 Docker Machine should now detect your shell automatically. If the automatic detection does not work, you
 can still override it using the `--shell` flag for `docker-machine env`.

For PowerShell:

```none
$ docker-machine.exe env --shell powershell dev
$Env:DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY = "1"
$Env:DOCKER_HOST = "tcp://192.168.99.101:2376"
$Env:DOCKER_CERT_PATH = "C:\Users\captain\.docker\machine\machines\dev"
$Env:DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME = "dev"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# docker-machine.exe env --shell=powershell dev | Invoke-Expression
```

For `cmd.exe`:

```none
$ docker-machine.exe env --shell cmd dev
set DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
set DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.101:2376
set DOCKER_CERT_PATH=C:\Users\captain\.docker\machine\machines\dev
set DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=dev
# Run this command to configure your shell: copy and paste the above values into your command prompt
```

## Excluding the created machine from proxies

The env command supports a `--no-proxy` flag which will ensure that the created
machine's IP address is added to the [`NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment
variable](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Proxy_settings).

This is useful when using `docker-machine` with a local VM provider (e.g.
`virtualbox` or `vmwarefusion`) in network environments where an HTTP proxy is
required for internet access.

```none
$ docker-machine env --no-proxy default
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.104:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/databus23/.docker/machine/certs"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="default"
export NO_PROXY="192.168.99.104"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
```

created daemon using the `--engine-env` flag for `docker-machine
create`](/machine/reference/create.md#specifying-configuration-options-for-the-created-docker-engine).
