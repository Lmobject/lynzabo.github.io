## 2.4.1

(20 November 2017)

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed a bug that cause certain vulnerabilities to not be found during scanning.
* Increased speed of lock expiration in case of failed joins.
* Fixed notification when toggling active status of webhooks.
* Speed up detection of dead jobrunners.
* Fixed a bug where garbage collection ran in a suboptimal mode if scheduled as
a cron from the UI.
* Fixed a potential issue with the way we untar files in uploads of the
vulnerability database.
* Fixed scanning issue with some windows images.
* Fixed a bug with not backing up repository team permissions correctly.

**General improvements**

* Improved resilience of garbage collection.
* Improved logging of garbage collection.
* Improved memory usage during backup.
* Improved error handling when uploading invalid vulnerability databases.
* Improve resilience of DTR join operations.
* Hide secrets on storage config pages.

**Deprecations**

* The `api/v0/imagescan/layer/{layerid}` endpoint is deprecated, and will be
removed in DTR 2.5. You can use the
`/api/v0/imagescan/repositories/{namespace}/{reponame}/{tag}` endpoint instead.


## DTR 2.4.0

(2 November 2017)

**New features**

* Upgraded to Swagger 2.0 and Swagger UI 3.0.
* DTR can now be deployed on IBM Z (s390x architecture).
* Updated the `docker/dtr-rethink` images to include `rethinkcli` for easier troubleshooting.
* Notary now allows you to see audit logs using the `/v2/_trust/changefeed`, and
`/v2/<repository>/_trust/changefeed` endpoints.

**Bug fixes**

* When setting up periodic garbage collection, it used to run in a different,
less thorough mode than when run manually. Now garbage collection always runs in
the correct mode.
* Fix error when garbage collecting manifest lists.
* Fixed issue when reconfiguring DTR from a non-local storage to NFS, causing the
change to not be persisted.
* Backported Docker Distribution race fix. [2299](https://github.com/docker/distribution/pull/2299)
* Reduced unnecessary logs in Jobrunner.
* Other general reliability improvements.

**Known issues**

* Backup uses too much memory and can cause out of memory issues for large databases.
* The `--nfs-storage-url` option uses the system's default NFS version instead
of testing the server to find which version works.
