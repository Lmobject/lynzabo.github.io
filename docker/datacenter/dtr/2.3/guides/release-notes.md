## 2.3.5

(20 November 2017)

* Fixed a bug with downloading storage yaml file on Firefox.
* Increased the speed of lock expiration in case of failed joins.

* Fixed the notification when toggling active status of webhooks.
* Fixed a bug where garbage collection ran in a suboptimal mode if scheduled as
a cron from the UI.

vulnerability database.

* Improved error handling when uploading invalid vulnerability databases.
* Fail faster in case of nfs volume issues.
* Improved resilience of DTR join operations.
* Hide secrets on storage config pages.

## DTR 2.3.4

(12 October 2017)

### Bugs fixed

* High severity
  * Fixed a bug in distribution that caused pull timeouts under load if using
  NFS or local storage. [#2299](https://github.com/docker/distribution/pull/2299)
  * Fixed GCS configuration UI.
* Low severity
  * Fixed missing show password button.
  * Removed incorrectly enforced length limit on repo names from UI.
  * Fixed small UI behavior and appearance inconsistencies.

## DTR 2.3.3

(13 September 2017)

### Bugs fixed

* High severity:
  * Fixed issue with RethinkDB not starting correctly after restarting a DTR
  replica.
  * Fixed issue that prevented UCP 2.1.x from being able to pull images.
* Low severity:
  * Improved error handling in the vulnerability scanner.
  * Fixed issue that caused webhooks not to fire when an image was automatically
  promoted.

## DTR 2.3.2

(25 August 2017)

### Bugs fixed

* High severity:
  * Add the ability to upgrade from 2.3.0 or 2.3.1

## DTR 2.3.1

(24 August 2017)

### Bugs fixed

* High severity:
  * Fixed a bug which caused upgrades to fail when upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3
  when DTR was previously upgraded from 2.1 to 2.2.
  * Make it possible to install DTR when the Docker daemon has SELinux enabled.
* Low severity:
  * In-product documentation for content cache now shows a simplified
  configuration format. The older configuration format is still supported for
  backwards compatibility.
  * When creating teams, the team name is validated in a way that's consistent
  with UCP.
  * The promotion policy creating form was sometimes disabled. This has been
  fixed.
  * Fixed bug that made users show as inactive, when they were actually active.

### Known issues

* You can't upgrade from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1. Please upgrade to 2.3.2 directly.

## DTR 2.3.0

(16 August 2017)

### New features

* Repositories can now be marked “immutable”. Tags for images in immutable repos
cannot be changed or updated.
* You can now define promotion policies, to automatically copy images from one
repository to another.
* DTR now has UX for easily creating webhooks for events in repositories such
as image pushes, scans, deletions, and promotions.
* Added support for scanning Windows images for vulnerabilities.
* Support was added for handling manifest-lists for multi-architecture images.
This lets you manage images for different operating systems (eg. Linux and
  Windows) and CPU architectures (eg. x86_64 and s390x) under a single tag.
* You can now use the web UI in Chinese.

## General improvements

#### UI/UX

* The users page is now paginated to decrease long load times.
* Fixed the login page to be more resilient to improperly configured domain names.
Now you can always use the `/login` URL to bypass SSO misconfiguration issues.

#### docker/dtr

* Removed requiring the `--dtr-external-url` flag during DTR installation.
* Improved error handling.
* Added extended help to the installer with the `--help-extended` flag.
* We check kernel versions on install to help avoid known kernel bugs.

#### Storage
* Preserve the NFS hostname instead of resolving it during DTR installation.
* Allow using S3 compatible storage with customized certificates or without TLS
verification.

#### Misc

* Simplified content cache configuration.
* Removed old, insecure 3des from the cipher list.
* Allow refresh tokens with basic auth when using the DTR API.
* Added the ability to rescan all previously scanned images at once.
* Fixed issue with configs not being picked up by containers sometimes which
previously required a restart of all containers.

### Known issues

* When running DTR 2.3.0 + UCP 2.1.x, UCP users cannot pull images from DTR without logging in first.
* When using SSO with UCP 2.1.0, you have to log into DTR and UCP separately.
* Some users are displayed as inactive when they are actually active. This only
happens when using pagination, and can be fixed by refreshing the browser.
