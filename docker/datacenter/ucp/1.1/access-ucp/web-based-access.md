Docker Universal Control Plane allows you to manage your cluster in a visual
way, from your browser.

Docker UCP secures your cluster with role-based access control. From the
browser, Administrators can:

* Manage cluster configurations,
* Manage the permissions of users and teams,
* See all images, networks, volumes, and containers.

Non-admin users can only see and change the images, networks, volumes, and
containers, they are granted access.
