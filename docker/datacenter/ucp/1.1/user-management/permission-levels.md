Docker Universal Control Plane has two types of users: administrators and
regular users. Administrators can make changes to the UCP cluster, while
regular users have permissions that range from no access to full control over
volumes, networks, images, and containers.

## Administrator users

In Docker UCP, only users with administrator privileges can make changes to
cluster settings. This includes:

* Managing user and team permissions,
* Managing cluster configurations like adding and removing nodes to the cluster.

## Default permission levels

Regular users can't change cluster settings, and they are assigned with a
default permission level.

The default permission level specify the permission a user has to access or
edit resources. You can choose from four permission levels that range from no
access to full control over the resources.

| Default permission level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `No Access`              | The user can't view any resource, like volumes, networks, images, or containers.                                                                                                                             |
| `View Only`              | The user can view volumes, networks and images, but can't create any containers.                                                                                                                             |
| `Restricted Control`     | The user can view and edit volumes, networks, and images. They can create containers, but can't see other users containers, run `docker exec`, or run containers that require privileged access to the host. |
| `Full Control`           | The user can view and edit volumes, networks, and images, They can create containers without any restriction, but can't see other users containers.                                                          |

When a user only has a default permission assigned, only them and admin
users can see the containers they deploy in the cluster.

**NOTE**: Full-control users can utilize host-mounted volumes, which can potentially gain 
 access to sensitive material on the cluster. We recommend giving full-control permissions 
 to users you would trust with admin-level access.

## Team permission levels

Teams allow you to define fine-grain permissions to containers that have the
label `com.docker.ucp.access.label` applied to them.

There are four permission levels:

| Team permission level | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `No Access`           | The user can't view containers with this label.                                                                                                      |
| `View Only`           | The user can view but can't create containers with this label.                                                                                       |
| `Restricted Control`  | The user can view and create containers with this label. The user can't run `docker exec`, or containers that require privileged access to the host. |
| `Full Control`        | The user can view and create containers with this label, without any restriction.                                                                    |
