Uninstall UCP from this swarm

## Description

This command uninstalls UCP from the swarm, but preserves the swarm so that
your applications can continue running.
After UCP is uninstalled, you can use the `docker swarm leave` and
`docker node rm` commands to remove nodes from the swarm.

Once UCP is uninstalled, you won't be able to join nodes to the swarm unless
UCP is installed again.
