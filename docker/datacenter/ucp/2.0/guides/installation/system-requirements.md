  Plane.

Docker Universal Control Plane can be installed on-premises or on the cloud.
Before installing, be sure your infrastructure has these requirements.

## Hardware and software requirements

You can install UCP on-premises or on a cloud provider. To install UCP,
all nodes must have:

* Linux kernel version 3.10 or higher
* CS Docker Engine version 1.12.1
* 8.00 GB of RAM for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
* 4.00 GB of RAM for worker nodes
* 3.00 GB of available disk space
* A static IP address

For highly-available installations, you also need a way to transfer files
between hosts.

> Workloads on manager nodes
>
> These requirements assume that manager nodes won't run regular workloads.
> If you plan to run additional workloads on manager nodes, you may need to
> provision more powerful nodes. If manager nodes become overloaded, the
> swarm may experience issues.

## Ports used

When installing UCP on a host, make sure the following ports are open:

| Hosts             | Direction | Port                    | Purpose                                                                           |

| managers          |    in     | TCP 12383               | Port for the authentication storage backend                                       |
