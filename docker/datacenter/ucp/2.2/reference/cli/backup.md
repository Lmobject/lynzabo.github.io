Create a backup of a UCP manager node

## Usage

```bash
docker container run --log-driver none --rm -i \
    --name ucp \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    docker/ucp \
    backup [command options] > backup.tar
```

## Description

This command creates a tar file with the contents of the volumes used by
this UCP manager node, and prints it. You can then use the `restore` command to
restore the data from an existing backup.

To create backups of a multi-node swarm, you only need to back up a single manager
node. The restore operation will reconstitute a new UCP installation from the
backup of any previous manager.

Note:

  * During the backup, UCP is temporarily stopped. This does not affect your
    applications.

  * The backup contains private keys and other sensitive information. Use the
    `--passphrase` flag to encrypt the backup with PGP-compatible encryption.
