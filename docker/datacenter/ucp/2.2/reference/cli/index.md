keywords: ucp, cli, ucp
---

This image has commands to install and manage
Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) on a Docker Engine.

You can configure the commands using flags or environment variables. When using
environment variables, use the `docker container run -e VARIABLE_NAME` syntax to pass the
value from your shell, or `docker container run -e VARIABLE_NAME=value` to specify the
value explicitly on the command line.

The container running this image needs to be named `ucp` and bind-mount the
Docker daemon socket. Below you can find an example of how to run this image.

Additional help is available for each command with the `--help` flag.

## Usage

```bash
docker container run -it --rm \
    --name ucp \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    {{ page.ucp_org }}/{{ page.ucp_repo }}:{{ page.ucp_version }} \
    command [command arguments]
```
