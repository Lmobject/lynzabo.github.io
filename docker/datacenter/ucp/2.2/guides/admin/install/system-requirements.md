Docker Universal Control Plane can be installed on-premises or on the cloud.
Before installing, be sure your infrastructure has these requirements.

## Hardware and software requirements

You can install UCP on-premises or on a cloud provider. Common requirements:

* [Docker Enterprise Edition](/engine/installation/index.md) version 17.06 or higher
* Linux kernel version 3.10 or higher
* A static IP address

### Minimum requirements

* 8GB of RAM for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
* 4GB of RAM for worker nodes
* 3GB of free disk space

### Recommended production requirements

 * 16GB of RAM for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
 * 4 vCPUs for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
 * 25-100GB of free disk space
 
Note that Windows container images are typically larger than Linux ones and for that reason, you should consider provisioning more local storage for Windows nodes and for DTR setups that will store Windows container images.

Note that, when planning for host storage, workflows based around `docker pull` through UCP will result in higher storage requirements on manager nodes, since `docker pull` through UCP results in the image being pulled on all nodes.

Also, make sure the nodes are running an [operating system support by Docker EE](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Compatibility_Matrix).

For highly-available installations, you also need a way to transfer files
between hosts.

> Workloads on manager nodes
>
> These requirements assume that manager nodes won't run regular workloads.
> If you plan to run additional workloads on manager nodes, you may need to
> provision more powerful nodes. If manager nodes become overloaded, the
> swarm may experience issues.

## Ports used

When installing UCP on a host, make sure the following ports are open:

| Hosts             | Direction | Port                    | Purpose                                                                           |

For overlay networks with encryption to work, you need to ensure that
IP protocol 50 (ESP) traffic is allowed.

Also, make sure the networks you're using allow the UCP components enough time
to communicate before they time out.

| Component                              | Timeout (ms) | Configurable |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Raft consensus between manager nodes   | 3000         | no           |
| Gossip protocol for overlay networking | 5000         | no           |
| etcd                                   | 500          | yes          |
| RethinkDB                              | 10000        | no           |
| Stand-alone swarm                      | 90000        | no           |

## Time Synchronization

In distributed systems like Docker UCP, time synchronization is critical
to ensure proper operation. As a best practice to ensure consistency between
the engines in a UCP swarm, all engines should regularly synchronize time
with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. If a server's clock is skewed,
unexpected behavior may cause poor performance or even failures.
