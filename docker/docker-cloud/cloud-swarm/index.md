Docker Cloud now allows you to connect to clusters of Docker Engines in [swarm mode](/engine/swarm/).

With Beta Swarm Mode in Docker Cloud, you can provision swarms to popular cloud
providers, or register existing swarms to Docker Cloud. Use your Docker ID to
authenticate and securely access personal or team swarms.
