title: Link a DigitalOcean account
---

You can link your DigitalOcean account to your Docker Cloud account to deploy
**nodes** and **node clusters** using Docker Cloud's Dashboard, API, and CLI.
You must link your DigitalOcean account so that Docker Cloud can interact with
DigitalOcean on your behalf to create and manage your **nodes** (droplets).

If you don't have a **DigitalOcean** account, you can sign up with this link to

## Link your DigitalOcean Account

To link your DigitalOcean account so you can launch **nodes** using Docker
Cloud, navigate to **Account info \> Cloud Providers**. You'll see a list of all
the providers that you can link to Docker Cloud. Click **Link account** next to
DigitalOcean.
