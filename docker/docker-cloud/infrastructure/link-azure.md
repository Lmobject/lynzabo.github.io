title: Link a Microsoft Azure account
---

You can link your Microsoft Azure account to your Docker Cloud account to deploy
**nodes** and **node clusters** using Docker Cloud's Dashboard, API, or CLI. You
must link your Azure account so that Docker Cloud can interact with Azure on
your behalf to create and manage your **nodes** (virtual machines).

## How to create the link

For instructions on how to link your Microsoft Azure account to Docker Cloud,
see [the Azure instructions that enable swarm
mode](/docker-cloud/cloud-swarm/link-azure-swarm.md).

> **Note**: The procedure for linking these accounts is the same, regardless
of whether you are using Docker Cloud in
[Swarm Mode](/docker-cloud/index.md) or not. If you are
using standard mode, come back to these topics after you have linked
your Microsoft Azure account.

## What's next?

You're ready to start using Microsoft Azure as the infrastructure provider for
Docker Cloud! If you came here from the tutorial, click here to [continue the
