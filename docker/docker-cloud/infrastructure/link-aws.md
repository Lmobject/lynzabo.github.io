You can create a role with AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) so that
Docker Cloud can provision and manage swarms on your behalf.

## How to create the link

For instructions on how to link your AWS account to Docker Cloud,
see [the AWS instructions that enable swarm
mode](/docker-cloud/cloud-swarm/link-aws-swarm.md).

> **Note**: The procedure for linking these accounts is the same, regardless
of whether you are using Docker Cloud in
[Swarm Mode](/docker-cloud/index.md) or not. If you are
using standard mode, come back to these topics after you have linked
your AWS account.

## What's next?

You're ready to start using AWS as the infrastructure provider for Docker Cloud!
If you came here from the tutorial, [continue the tutorial and deploy your first
node](/docker-cloud/getting-started/your_first_node.md).
