title: Deploy the app as a Docker Cloud service
---

In this step you will deploy the app as a Docker Cloud Service. Remember that a service is a group of containers of the same **image:tag**.

## Deploy app with Docker Engine installed locally

> **Note**: By default, the `docker-cloud` CLI uses your default user namespace,
meaning the repositories, nodes, and services associated with your individual
Docker ID account name. To use the CLI to interact with objects that belong to
an [organization](../../orgs.md), prefix these commands with
`DOCKERCLOUD_NAMESPACE=my-organization`. See the [CLI documentation](../../installing-cli.md#use-the-docker-cloud-cli-with-an-organization) for more information.

Start by running the service.

```bash
$ docker-cloud service run -p 80 --name web $DOCKER_ID_USER/quickstart-python
```

or

```bash
$ docker-cloud service run -p 80 --name web $DOCKER_ID_USER/quickstart-go
```

## The run command

The `run` command **creates and runs** the service using the image you chose.
The **-p 80** flag publishes port 80 in the container so that it is publicly
accessible, and maps it to a dynamically assigned port in the node.

It might take a minute or two to get your service up and running. Once it
completes the startup process, it will be in the *running* state.

To check the status of your service from the CLI use the `docker-cloud service ps` command.

```none
$ docker-cloud service ps
NAME                 UUID      STATUS     IMAGE                                          DEPLOYED
web                  68a6fb2c  ▶ Running  my-username/quickstart-python:latest           1 hour ago
```

Make sure that the **STATUS** for your service is **Running**. Next, visit the
app at the URL generated by its service name. Find this URL by running
`docker-cloud container ps --no-trunc`.

```none
$ docker-cloud container ps --no-trunc
NAME                   UUID      STATUS     IMAGE                                          RUN COMMAND          EXIT CODE  DEPLOYED      PORTS
web-1                  6c89f20e  ▶ Running  my-username/quickstart-python:latest           python app.py                   1 minute ago  web-1.my-username.cont.dockerapp.io:49162->80/tcp
```

The **PORTS** column contains the URL you can use to see the service running in
a browser. Copy the URL, open a browser, and go to that URL. In the example above, the URL is
`web-1.my-username.cont.dockerapp.io:49162`.

If you don't want to leave the command line, you can use the `curl` command instead.

```bash
$ curl web-1.$DOCKER_ID_USER.cont.dockerapp.io:49162
Hello World!</br>Hostname: web-1</br>Counter: Redis Cache not found, counter disabled.%
```
> **Tip**: Your Docker ID is used as part of the namespace when running containers in Docker Cloud. In the example above, instead of copying the URL entirely, you can see we used the $DOCKER_ID_USER variable.

**CONGRATULATIONS!** You've deployed your first service using Docker Cloud.
