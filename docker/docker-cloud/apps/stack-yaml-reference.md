title: Docker Cloud stack file YAML reference
---

A stack is a collection of services that make up an application in a specific environment. Learn more about stacks for Docker Cloud [here](stacks.md). A **stack file** is a file in YAML format that defines one or more services, similar to a `docker-compose.yml` file for Docker Compose but with a few extensions. The default name for this file is `docker-cloud.yml`.

**Looking for information on stack files for Swarm?** A good place to start is the [Compose reference file](/compose/compose-file/index.md), particularly the section on `deploy` key and its sub-options, and the reference on [Docker stacks](/compose/bundles.md). Also, the new [Getting Started tutorial](/get-started/index.md) demos use of a stack file to deploy an application to a swarm.

## Stack file example

Below is an example `docker-cloud.yml`:

```yml
lb:
  image: dockercloud/haproxy
  links:
    - web
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  roles:
    - global
web:
  image: dockercloud/quickstart-python
  links:
    - redis
  target_num_containers: 4
redis:
  image: redis
```

Each key defined in `docker-cloud.yml` creates a service with that name in Docker Cloud. In the example above, three services are created: `lb`, `web`, and `redis`. Each service is a dictionary whose possible keys are documented below.

The `image` key is mandatory. Other keys are optional and are analogous to their [Docker Cloud Service API](/apidocs/docker-cloud.md#create-a-new-service) counterparts.

## image (required)

The image used to deploy this service. This is the only mandatory key.

```yml
image: drupal
image: dockercloud/hello-world
image: my.registry.com/redis
```

## autodestroy
Whether the containers for this service should be terminated if they stop (default: `no`, possible values: `no`, `on-success`, `always`).

```yml
autodestroy: always
```

## autoredeploy
Whether to redeploy the containers of the service when its image is updated in Docker Cloud registry (default: `false`).

```yml
autoredeploy: true
```

## cap_add, cap_drop
Add or drop container capabilities. See `man 7 capabilities` for a full list.

```yml
cap_add:
  - ALL
cap_drop:
  - NET_ADMIN
  - SYS_ADMIN
```

## cgroup_parent
Specify an optional parent cgroup for the container.

```yml
cgroup_parent: m-executor-abcd
```

## command
Override the default command in the image.

```yml
command: echo 'Hello World!'
```

## deployment_strategy
Container distribution among nodes (default: `emptiest_node`, possible values: `emptiest_node`, `high_availability`, `every_node`). Learn more [here](../infrastructure/deployment-strategies.md).

```yml
deployment_strategy: high_availability
```

## devices
List of device mappings. Uses the same format as the `--device` docker client create option.

```yml
devices:
  - "/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"
```

## dns
Specify custom DNS servers. Can be a single value or a list.

```yml
dns: 8.8.8.8
dns:
  - 8.8.8.8
  - 9.9.9.9
```

## dns_search
Specify custom DNS search domains. Can be a single value or a list.

```yml
dns_search: example.com
dns_search:
  - dc1.example.com
  - dc2.example.com
```

## environment
A list of environment variables to add in the service's containers at launch. The environment variables specified here override any image-defined environment variables. You can use either an array or a dictionary format.

Dictionary format:
```yml
environment:
    PASSWORD: my_password
```

Array format:
```yml
environment:
  - PASSWORD=my_password
```

When you use the Docker Cloud CLI to create a stack, you can use the environment variables defined locally in your shell to define those in the stack. This is useful if you don't want to store passwords or other sensitive information in your stack file:

```yml
environment:
  - PASSWORD
```

## expose
Expose ports without publishing them to the host machine - they'll only be accessible from your nodes in Docker Cloud. `udp` ports can be specified with a `/udp` suffix.

```yml
expose:
 - "80"
 - "90/udp"
```

## extra_hosts
Add hostname mappings. Uses the same values as the docker client `--add-host` parameter.

```yml
extra_hosts:
  - "somehost:162.242.195.82"
  - "otherhost:50.31.209.229"
```

## labels
Add metadata to containers using Docker Engine labels. You can use either an array or a dictionary.

We recommend using reverse-DNS notation to prevent your labels from conflicting with those used by other software.

```yml
labels:
  com.example.description: "Accounting webapp"
  com.example.department: "Finance"
  com.example.label-with-empty-value: ""

labels:
  - "com.example.description=Accounting webapp"
  - "com.example.department=Finance"
  - "com.example.label-with-empty-value"
```

## links
Link to another service.

Either specify both the service unique name and the link alias (`SERVICE:ALIAS`), or just the service unique name (which will also be used for the alias). If a service you want to link to is part of a different stack, specify the external stack name too.

- If the target service belongs to *this* stack, its service unique name is its service name.
- If the target service does not belong to *any* stacks (it is a standalone service), its service unique name is its service name.
- If the target service belongs to another stack, its service unique name is its service name plus the service stack name, separated by a period (`.`).

```yml
links:
 - mysql
 - redis:cache
 - amqp.staging:amqp
```

Environment variables are created for each link that Docker Cloud resolves to the containers IPs of the linked service. More information [here](service-links.md).

## net
Networking mode. Only "bridge" and "host" options are supported for now.

```yml
net: host
```

## pid
Sets the PID mode to the host PID mode. This turns on sharing between container and the host operating system PID address space. Containers launched with this (optional) flag will be able to access and be accessed by other containers in the namespace belonging to the host running the Docker daemon.

```yml
pid: "host"
```

## ports
Expose ports. Either specify both ports (`HOST:CONTAINER`), or just the container port (a random host port will be chosen). `udp` ports can be specified with a `/udp` suffix.

```yml
ports:
 - "80"
 - "443:443"
 - "500/udp"
 - "4500:4500/udp"
 - "49022:22"
```

## privileged

Whether to start the containers with Docker Engine's privileged flag set or not (default: `false`).

```yml
privileged: true
```

## restart
Whether the containers for this service should be restarted if they stop (default: `no`, possible values: `no`, `on-failure`, `always`).

```yml
restart: always
```

## roles
A list of Docker Cloud API roles to grant the service. The only supported value is `global`, which creates an environment variable `DOCKERCLOUD_AUTH` used to authenticate against Docker Cloud API. Learn more [here](api-roles.md).

```yml
roles:
 - global
```

## security_opt
Override the default labeling scheme for each container.

```yml
security_opt:
  - label:user:USER
  - label:role:ROLE
```

## sequential_deployment
Whether the containers should be launched and scaled in sequence (default: `false`). Learn more [here](service-scaling.md).

```yml
sequential_deployment: true
```

## tags
Indicates the [deploy tags](deploy-tags.md) to select the nodes where containers are created.

```yml
tags:
 - staging
 - web
```

## target_num_containers
The number of containers to run for this service (default: `1`).

```yml
target_num_containers: 3
```

## volumes
Mount paths as volumes, optionally specifying a path on the host machine (`HOST:CONTAINER`), or an access mode (`HOST:CONTAINER:ro`).

```yml
volumes:
 - /etc/mysql
 - /sys:/sys
 - /etc:/etc:ro
```

## volumes_from
Mount all of the volumes from another service by specifying a service unique name. 

- If the target service belongs to this stack, its service unique name is its service name. 
- If the target service does not belong to any stack, its service unique name is its service name. 
- If the target service belongs to another stack, its service unique name is its service name plus the service stack name, separated by ".". Learn more [here](volumes.md).

```yml
volumes_from:
 - database
 - mongodb.staging
```

## Single value keys analogous to a `docker run` counterpart

```
working_dir: /app
entrypoint: /app/entrypoint.sh
user: root
hostname: foo
domainname: foo.com
mac_address: 02:42:ac:11:65:43
cpu_shares: 512
cpuset: 0,1
mem_limit: 100000m
memswap_limit: 200000m
privileged: true
read_only: true
stdin_open: true
tty: true
```

## Unsupported Docker-compose keys

Stack files (`docker-cloud.yml`) were designed with `docker-compose.yml` in mind to maximize compatibility. However the following keys used in Compose are not supported in Docker Cloud stackfiles:

```
build
external_links
env_file
```
