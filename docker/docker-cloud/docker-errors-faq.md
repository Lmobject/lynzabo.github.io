This is a list of known issues with current versions of Docker Engine along with
our recommended workaround. You might encounter these errors in Docker Cloud.

## Errors and messages

## Get i/o timeout

<!-- span tag prevents irritating autolinker from interpreting this as a link -->

*Get https<span></span>://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/\<image\>/images: dial tcp: lookup \<registry host> on \<ip>:53: read udp \<ip>:53: i/o timeout*

### Description

The DNS resolver configured on the host cannot resolve the registry's hostname.

N/A

### Workaround

Retry the operation, or if the error persists, use another DNS resolver. You can do this by updating your `/etc/resolv.conf` file with these or other DNS servers:

	nameserver 8.8.8.8
	nameserver 8.8.4.4

pulling the required image.
