title: Docker for Windows Release notes
---

Here are the main improvements and issues per release, starting with the current
release. The documentation is always updated for each release.

For system requirements, please see
[What to know before you install](install.md#what-to-know-before-you-install).

Release notes for _stable_ and _edge_ releases are listed below. (Starting with
the CE release model, `beta` releases are called `edge` releases.) You can learn
about both kinds of releases, and download stable and edge product installers at
[Download Docker for Windows](install.md#download-docker-for-windows).
