For developers and operators, Docker Store is the best way to discover
high-quality Docker content.

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) can utilize Docker Store to distribute and
sell their Dockerized content. Publish your software through Docker Store to
experience the following benefits:

* **Access to Docker’s large and growing customer-base.** Docker has experienced
  rapid adoption, and is popular in dev-ops environments. Docker users have
  pulled images over twelve billion times and they are increasingly turning to
  Docker Store as the canonical source for high-quality, curated content.

* **Customers can try or buy your software**, right from your product listing.
  Your content is accessible for installation, trial, and purchase from the
  Docker Store and the Docker CLI.

* **Use of Docker licensing support.** Control who has access to your software:
  a) logged-in users, b) users who have purchased a license, or c) all Docker
  users. We’ll help you manage and control your distribution.

* **We'll handle checkout.** You don’t have to set up your own digital
  e-commerce site when you sell your content through the Docker Store. Choose
  how much you want to charge for your products and we'll handle the billing.

* **Seamless updates and upgrades for your customers.** We tell your customers
  when your content has upgrades or updates available.

* **Become Docker Certified.** Publisher container images and plugins that meet
  the quality, security, and support criteria of the program will display a
  “Docker Certified” badge within the Docker Store (which can be used in
  external marketing).

## How is Docker Store different from Docker Hub? What about Official Images?

Docker Hub contains community content - these are images that have been created
by entities that are not vetted or curated. You can think of the community
content you consume as the "Wild West"--anyone can push new images to the
community and there are no guarantees around the quality or compatibility of
this content.

Docker Store contains content that has been submitted for approval by qualified
Store Vendor Partners. These products are published and maintained directly by a
commercial entity. In addition, the Docker Certified logo distinguishes content
by providing quality, provenance, and support assurances.

Official Images are an exception when it comes to community content; these
images are maintained as open source community projects. All official images
adhere to strict guidelines but are not necessarily backed by a commercial
entity.

> **Note**: Docker Hub and Docker Store leverage the same backend, the Docker
> Public Registry. In general, all publicly available community content should
> be visible via both Docker Hub and Docker Store, and this includes official
> images. Any content that has explicitly been added by a commercial entity and
> has gone through a vetting process with respect to content submission and best
> practices, is only available on Docker Store.

## Distribution models

The Docker Store welcomes free and open-source content, as well as software sold
directly by publishers. We support the following commercial models:

### Paid via Docker

This commercial model allows customers to pay for ISV content via Docker, as
described in the Store Vendor Partner agreement. Paid-via-Docker content
includes both software that can be deployed on a host, as well as software that
runs in the cloud and can be accessed by the customer via an agent
(containerized cloud services, for example).

### Licensed content via Docker Store BYOL program

ISVs can use Docker Store as an entitlement and distribution platform. Using
APIs provided by Docker, ISVs can entitle users and distribute their Dockerized
content to many different audiences:
* Existing customers that want their licensed software made available as Docker containers.
* New customers that are only interested in consuming their software as Docker containers.
* Trial or beta customers, where the ISV can distribute feature or time limited software.

Docker provides a fulfillment service so that ISVs can programmatically entitle
users, by creating subscriptions to their content in Docker Store. For more
information, see [Bring Your Own License (BYOL) products on Store](byol.md).

### Plugins and agents

ISVs have the ability to create and distribute [plugin images](https://store.docker.com/search?certification_status=certified&q=&type=plugin) for their customers to integrate with the ISV's proprietary hardware or cloud infrastructure and Docker Enterprise Edition deployments.
